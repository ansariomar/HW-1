Because the group project from the Wear Tech class will no lonherbenefit or satisfy the requirements of this class, I have decided to take my final project in a less utilitarian more artistic/creative direction.  

I plan to to create a piece of "robotic poetry" that demonstrates the often unseen and underappreciated relationship between the analog and digital world of experience and technology.  Using a DC motor to power a homemade phonograph in tandem with a repurposed piezo speaker from an inkjet printer, I will play a track in both its analog and digital form.  Ideally I'll add a 3rd dimension to the experience by creating a visualization of the sound using the piezo speaker's vibrations to move grains of sand on a thin membrane.
