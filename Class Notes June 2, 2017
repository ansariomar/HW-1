Testing motor without H-bridge

Testing H-bridge without Arduino

Testing program without H-bridge

2 types of voltage AC (alternating current) and DC (direct current)

How test a multimeter: place black wire in grnd on breadboard and red wire into 5V= should read between 4.75-5.25V

/* until /* is all treated as comment whereas // is only treated as a comment for the line it is written on

Distance Measuring Sensor

VCC: to Arduino 5V
GND: to Arduino GND
Trig: Emits sonic pulse for location (output)
Echo: Listens/receives pulse completing the loop (input)

code uses microseconds because milliseconds are too long for it to operate properly

```
long duration, distance;
